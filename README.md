# peppermint

peppermint is a personal finance app that you can find [here](https://sharlagelfand.shinyapps.io/peppermint/).
it reads in data (transactions, budget, savings history, expected monthly income/savings) from googlesheets and shows:

- the current month's spending by category, showing % of total income spent on that category, and $ amount
- an itemized transaction list of the current month's spending
- each month's spending, over time
- the current month's savings, to date (compared to the goal, input via googlesheet)
- total savings, over time

the public version of this app has all values multiplied by a random number between 0.1 and 5 because personal finances are personal!
the transaction list 'descriptions' (i.e., where i buy things) have similarly been replaced with random strings.
